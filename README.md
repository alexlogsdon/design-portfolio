My information design experience made me a generalist of communication in many mediums. 🌎
Words and pictures are my tools. 🎨 🖍 
Projects as varied as museums, workbooks, and infographics are the final result. 🙌

## Dating Profiles for Humans

I conceptualized, wrote, and designed a digital workbook that walks online daters
through the process of writing a dating app profile.

• Maintained a conversational and relatable tone along with clear, informative instructions.
• Crafted the copy, structure, and visual design to work together seamlessly.
• Conducted user tests at various stages of development.

## Letters from Mars

I fully researched, wrote, and designed a hypothetical museum exhibit. It uses science fiction to encourage visitors to look at historical artifacts using their imagination.

* Transformed dense medieval texts into an engaging interactive experience.
* Structured the exhibit to guide the user through a learning experience: "Curiosity," "discovery," then "understanding."
* Wrote the exhibit script. 
* Integrated techniques used by history educators.

## Experience Narratives

At Jack Rouse Associates, I helped an international brand find focus in their story during the conceptual design phase of their museum. 

* Spoke to the guest's perspective (rather than their corporate point of view). 
* Synthesized an abundance of research and information that had been collected.
* Used information design to communicate the interdisciplinary design team's ideas. Forms included diagrams, text analysis, written outlines, and slide presentations. These facilitated more effective discussions during client meetings.
* The story transformed over time as we balanced brand needs, guest experience needs, and the boundaries of the physical exhibition space.
